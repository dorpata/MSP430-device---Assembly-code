# MSP430-device---Assembly-code
Using Assembly to interface with MSP430 microcontroller. 
1. GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) Led, Switch, Push-Button - change the input signal Dutycycle according to the switches position. show on LEDs.
2. Modes Operating, Interrupts - I write a code that expands the Hardware interrupt mechanism and supports prioritization of interrupt according to
   priority level, even when not happening together. This means, in the case of the arrival of a interrupt at a higher priority level, 
   the CPU will handle the high priority interrupt And then will return to treat the low priority level.
